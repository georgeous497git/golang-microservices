Microservices with Go

In Golang we need to use the “http” package that provides the Server instance, also we should declare the method “HandleFunc” that register a function to a given path on a thing called “default serve MUX” which is a http handler that redirect paths. 

To Run:

$ go run main.go

$ curl -v localhost:9090/
